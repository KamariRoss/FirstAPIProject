Explosion Api
You have already solved the explosion and mumbling katas. The client loves your solution so much that they want you to turn it into an API us on the web.

For this assignment, create a simple API with two endpoints, one for the explosion and one for the mumbling.

Objectives
Create a simple API
Practice problem solving
Requirements
Create 2 endpoints, /api/mumbling and api/explosion, that are based off of the katas,[https://www.codewars.com/kata/mumbling](https://www.codewars.com/kata/mumbling) and [https://www.codewars.com/kata/digits-explosion](https://www.codewars.com/kata/digits-explosion) respectfully.
Explorer Mode
Create a new sdg-api api project
Create a endpoint for the mumbling endpoint
Create a new Controller called MumblingController
This will have one HttpGet
The one get will accept a string
This endpoint will take the string passed to it, manipulate according to the kata https://www.codewars.com/kata/mumbling and return the result
This will return a string
Create a endpoint for the explosion endpoint
Create a new Controller called ExplosionController
This will have one HttpGet
The one get will accept a string
This endpoint will take the string passed to it, manipulate according to the kata hhttps://www.codewars.com/kata/digits-explosion and return the result
